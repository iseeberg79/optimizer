    the largest coefficient moves by three orders, from 1.6e-1 where market prices go negative to
    3e2 on the peak levelling ones, so a single constant lands the same model anywhere in that
    range and a fixed 1e6 pushes six of nineteen past 1e6 in the model handed to the solver.

    Anchored on the largest coefficient and not on the smallest: the smallest is a strategy tie
    breaker, deliberately tiny, and aiming that one at a floor drags the whole objective down with
    it. Measured, that costs 3 requests of 335 their solution and runs others three times past the
    time limit, because the objective ends up orders below a constraint matrix that carries a big M
    of 1e6. The span within a model is up to 1e8 and no single factor can fix that, only the model.
