# Objective term hierarchy 

## Tier table

| Tier | Term | Formula | Multiple of `penalty_base` | Scaled coefficient range | Intent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — hard-avoidance** | SOC limit exceedance | `prc_soc_exc_pen = penalty_base·1000` | ×1000 | 1.6e5 – 3.0e8 | must basically never happen |
| | Unmet charge goal | `prc_e_goal_pen = penalty_base·100` | ×100 | 1.6e4 – 3.0e7 | strong avoid |
| | Unmet charge demand | `prc_p_goal_pen = penalty_base·100`  | ×100 | 1.6e4 – 3.0e7 | strong avoid |
| | Import limit exceedance | `prc_e_grid_imp_pen = penalty_base·100` | ×100 | 1.6e4 – 3.0e7 | strong avoid |
| | Export limit exceedance | `prc_e_grid_exp_pen·(1−t·1e-5) = penalty_base·100·(≈1)` | ×100 | 1.6e4 – 3.0e7 | strong avoid |
| **2 — real economics** | Grid import cost | `p_N[t]` | *(raw, and now also feeds `penalty_base` via `max_import_price`)* | ~-1 – 3e5 | actual currency |
| | Grid export revenue | `p_E[t]` | *(raw, now also feeds `penalty_base` via `max_export_price`)* | ~0 – 3e5 | actual currency |
| | Final SOC value | `bat.p_a` | *(raw, now also feeds `penalty_base` directly)* | ~1.7e2 (up to whatever `p_a` is configured) | actual currency |
| | Demand-rate charge | `grid.prc_p_exc_imp` | *(raw; `prc_p_exc_imp·3600/min(dt)` now also feeds `penalty_base`, only when `p_max_imp` makes the rate active)* | unbounded, but tier 1 now tracks it | actual currency |
| **3 — tie-break nudges** | Peak leveling | `prc_p_peak = penalty_base·1e-3` | ×1e-3 | 0.16 – 300 | shape, not cost |
| | Deviation leveling | `prc_p_dev = penalty_base·1e-5`, per step | ×1e-5 | 1.6e-3 – 3.0 | shape, not cost |
| | Charge-before-export | `min_import_price·2e-5·(T−t)` | ×2e-5·(T−t) | ~1e-3 – tens | shape, not cost |
| | Discharge-before-import | `min_import_price·5e-6·(T−t)` | ×5e-6·(T−t) | ~1e-4 – tens | shape, not cost |
| | Charging priority | `min_import_price·5e-5·(T−t)·c_priority`, on `c` and on `d` | ×5e-5·(T−t)·c_priority | ~1e-3 – tens | shape, not cost |

## What the table does not show

- The SOC penalty is charged per time step, so a violation lasting the whole horizon is paid for
  once per step while one confined to a single step is paid for once. `penalty_base` is sized
  against the single-step case, which is the weaker of the two.
- Peak leveling is charged once on a single value, not per step, so its weight does not grow with
  the horizon or change with the sampling.
- Peak leveling has a blind spot on its own. The maximum is one value out of the horizon, so once a
  load the schedule cannot touch pins it, nothing orders the steps below it: a plateau, a jagged
  profile and a single spike of the same energy score identically. A ramp leveling term at
  `penalty_base·1e-5` used to order them; it was dropped because it priced transitions only, so it
  could not tell a straight climb from a plateau either, and the second absolute value system over
  the same grid power cost around a fifth of the solve time of a leveling case.
- Deviation leveling replaced it, pricing each step's distance from the horizon's own time weighted
  average instead of from the neighboring step. That closes the peak term's blind spot on the
  quality a ramp term could not tell apart either: a plateau scores best, a straight climb does not
  score the same as one. It needs no variable of its own for the average (a linear expression over
  the existing per-step grid energy), so it costs one variable and two constraints per step, the
  same order as the dropped ramp term, but `tools/bench_peak_leveling.py --sweep` measures under 1 %
  total solve time overhead on the stored cases against ~21 % lower deviation, worst case -64 %, and
  never a higher peak or a higher cost, across 486 pinned-peak cases. `test_peak_leveling` pins the
  blind spot closed.
- The tier 3 terms keyed off `min_import_price` invert sign when market prices go negative, the
  reason peak and deviation leveling use `penalty_base` instead.
- Tier 3 is not solved together with the tiers above it. `solve()` maximizes tiers 1 and 2 first,
  then maximizes tier 3 over the schedules that keep that value, so the distance between the tiers
  no longer decides whether a preference is respected. The ranges listed above are what the second
  stage works on, and it normalizes them off its own largest coefficient before solving.
